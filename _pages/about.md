About me
------
I am a Master's student at Electrical Engineering Department, Stanford University.
I am extremely fortunate to be advised Prof. [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/). 
Before that, I studied as an undergraduate at Electrical Engineering Department, Tsinghua University. 
I am broadly interested in natrual language processing and artificial intelligence.
